**Functions Implemented**
*Signup-> Complete Profile -> Add/Join a House -> Add item -> Find item -> Search item*

## :memo: The Process

For this project, I came up with an idea for an app that uses a bluetooth tracker to keep track of any item in your house. This tracker would connect to the app on your phone and use either bluetooth proximity, sound, or light to locate the object if needed.

### :book: Market Research
First, I researched a bit on the various apps in the market that already provide similar functionality and jotted down what features I thought were useful, and what weren't. Then, I decided to **describe the functionality** and also **define an ideal user base** along with a detailed description of one **user profile**. I also wrote down my goals for this app as a designer.

### :round_pushpin: Mappin' It Out
After doing this initial basic research, I started off with a *content map* and *interaction map* and then also made a *non visual paper prototype* of my app. I tested it out on my friends and family and made changes as needed. Taking this input into account, as well as my intitial maps, I proceeded to make a **sitemap** that shows my 3 main functions. I made the sitemap on *Adobe Illustrator*.

### :art: Abstract to Structured
After I was satisfied with the sitemap, I designed **basic wireframes** using **Adobe XD**. I mapped out my entire app through these wireframes. Next, I did some **visual research** and decided what my app was going to look like. I decided on *black and blue*, because I wanted a serious look for the app. Then I proceeded to make mockups of my app using these colors and some good typography and icons and then **prototyped** the entire app with subtle but effective transitions and small animations where I thought it was necessary.
